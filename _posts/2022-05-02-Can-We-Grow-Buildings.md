Can we grow buildings for large human settlements? 

Biomineralization is the study of biologically produced materials, such as shells, bone, and teeth, and the processes that lead to the formation of these hierarchically structured organicâˆ’inorganic composites. Organisms that posses this extraordinary power include coral polyps, which can build an insane structure of calcium carbonate, durable enough to last millions of years. 

Is it possible to harness the engineering skills of corals and build entire buildings out of prefab templates? Instead of pouring concrete on to  steel beams, we can place the prefab templates under seawater, and let the biomineralization do the work. Can we make aquatic cities this way?
