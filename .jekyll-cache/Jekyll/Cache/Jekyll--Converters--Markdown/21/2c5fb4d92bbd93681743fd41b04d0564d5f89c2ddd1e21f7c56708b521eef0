  Welcome! My name is John and I am a second year engineering student. This is my personal website where I blog about my interests and in general, my thoughts. serves as an example for the Bay Jekyll theme. Bay is a very simple and minimal theme, directly inspired by Dan Grover's <a href="http://dangrover.com">website</a>.
