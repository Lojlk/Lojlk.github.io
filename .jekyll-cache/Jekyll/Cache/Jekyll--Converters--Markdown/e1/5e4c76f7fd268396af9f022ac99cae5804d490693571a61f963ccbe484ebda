I"R<p>First “serious” post. 
Managed to memorise and break into 200 digits within 5 mins couple days ago. Simply unreal. The human brain IS plastic. Prior to this personal achievement, I didn’t even know memorising 100 random decimal digits is remotely possible.</p>

<p>In the long term, I want to become the best memoriser in Australia. I do think that this is within my capability. For now, I need to know my images well and solidify them. I am Changing them too much. I don’t think I will blog much but I will see.</p>

<p>The next goal: 300 random decimals digits within 5 mins.</p>
